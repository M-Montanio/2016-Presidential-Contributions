# 2016-Presidential-Contributions

This is a project I completed for Udacity's Data Analyst Program. This project explores over 7 million contributions made to the 2016 
presidential campaigns using R. There are several exploratory data analysis sections and then a final section that presents critical findings.
The dataset used can be found on the FEC website <https://classic.fec.gov/disclosurep/pnational.do>.

The final plots 3 plots are saved to a .pdf in the repository.
